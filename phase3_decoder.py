"""
Phase 3: Language Decoder
==========================
Takes per-keystroke softmax probability vectors from the Ensemble model
and recovers the most likely English words/sentences using:

  1. Beam Search   — explores top-K character paths through the prob matrix
  2. Dictionary    — filters beam candidates to real English words
  3. N-gram LM     — ranks candidates by word frequency + bigram context
  4. Viterbi       — optimal word sequence for multi-word sentences

TWO MODES
---------
A) Evaluation mode  (default)
   Loads results/ensemble_probs.npz, synthetically assembles random
   3–8 letter words from the test keystroke probs, decodes them, and
   reports: raw accuracy / beam@1 / beam@3 / LM-reranked.
   Use this to measure the decoder's benefit before you have free_type data.

B) Live / sentence mode
   WordDecoder and SentenceDecoder classes are importable for real-time use.
   Feed them one probability vector per keystroke; they emit word candidates.

Run:
  .venv/bin/python3 phase3_decoder.py              # eval mode
  .venv/bin/python3 phase3_decoder.py --demo       # demo on fixed sentences
  .venv/bin/python3 phase3_decoder.py --sentence "hello world"  # encode+decode

    Simulate word-level decoding on isolated keystroke data.

    Since ensemble_probs.npz contains individual isolated keystrokes (not

      2. Group consecutive samples whose true labels spell a valid English word.
